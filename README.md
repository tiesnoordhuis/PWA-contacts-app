# PWA with MongoDB Example

This repository serves as an educational example of building a Progressive Web App (PWA) with MongoDB integration. It's designed to help beginning developers understand the fundamentals of PWAs and NoSQL databases through a practical, step-by-step approach.

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate the core concepts of Progressive Web Apps
- Show how to integrate MongoDB with a web application
- Provide a clear, readable codebase that follows modern web standards
- Focus on essential features and maintainable code structure
- Create a learning resource with a natural progression in the git history

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Service Workers
  - Web App Manifest

- **Backend:**
  - MongoDB (Document/NoSQL Database)
  - Node.js (for local development server)

## Development Setup

1. **Local Server:**
   ```bash
   npx http-serve -p 6789
   ```

2. **Public Access:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http --domain=<DOMAIN>.ngrok-free.app 6789
   ```

## Project Structure

The project will be built in incremental steps, with each commit representing a logical progression in the development process. This approach allows learners to:

- Understand the basic structure first
- Add features progressively
- See the evolution of the application
- Learn best practices through practical examples

## Learning Path

1. Basic PWA setup
2. MongoDB integration
3. Service Worker implementation
4. Offline capabilities
5. Data synchronization
6. Progressive enhancement
